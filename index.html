<div id="content1" class="TextWrap">
    <p id="question-good">Who is the audience?</p>
    <p>The audience is people that are interested in both the origins of memes over the past decade as well as people who are interested in internet culture as a whole and how it has evolved from 2010-2022.</p>
    <p id="question-good">What message and questions does this visualization convey and answer?</p>
    <p>This visualization answers the questions of which social platforms had the largest hand in where popular memes came from - the percentage of shares a platform had during a given year. It also gives viewers insight, to some extent, of how different social media platforms eb and flow in popularity during the twelve year span analyzed. We can see that certain social media platforms are more prevalent during certain time spans in terms of where popular memes originate from.</p>
    <p id="question-good">What data is encoded in the visualization?</p>
    <p>Information on the percent of the shares of origination of memes in a twelve year time span from nine different social media platforms.</p>
    <p id="question-good">How does the visualization encode the data?</p>
    <p>It encodes it in a line chart that uses color to distinguish which social media platform corresponds to which line tracing percentage.</p>
    <p id="question-good">What tasks do readers perform on the visualization?</p>
    <p>Readers are able to compare the percentage of origination per year that each social media company had. They are also able to gain insight into the influence these platforms have had over the past decade and draw conclusions about the popularity of said platforms.</p>
    <p id="question-good">How are the five principles applied to this visualization?</p>
    <p>Beautiful: It is aesthetically pleasing to look at and the colors in specific compliment one another nicely making it beautiful to viewers. Functional: The graph is constructed in a way that it can be easily analyzed by viewers with the lines being easily distinguishable and the data being easy to understand and digest. Insightful: It uses data - looking at where memes were shared from - that as readers we would not necessarily have access to, and certainly would not look at a sample this size without this graph being available. Truthful: The visualization is truthful because it took a sample of between 700-1,400 memes and analyzed the percentage of meme origin shares it had across nine different platforms. Enlightening: It is enlightening because as readers we can understand where memes are being shared from and how this relates to both the popularity of certain platforms over a given period of time and how platforms eb and flow in popularity.</p>
    <p id="question-good">Why is this visualization good or bad?</p>
    <p>We believe that this visualization is good because it is not only aesthetically pleasing and conveys interesting and relevant information about the origin of popular memes, but because it is truthful and easy to understand for readers. The design itself is very clean and straightforward, which limits the need for over-analysis by readers and the possibility of misunderstanding the data. The use of color in the line chart makes it easy to identify which line corresponds to which company and track the overall progression of meme origins.</p>
