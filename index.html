      </div>
      <div class="TextWrap">
          <p class="question">Who is the audience?</p>
          <p>The audience is people that are interested in both the origins of memes over the past decade as well as people who are interested in internet culture as a whole and how it has evolved from 2010-2022.</p>
          <p class="question">What message and questions does this visualization convey and answer?</p>
          <p>This visualization answers the questions of which social platforms had the largest hand in where popular memes came from - the percentage of shares a platform had during a given year. It also gives viewers insight, to some extent, of how different social media platforms eb and flow in popularity during the twelve year span analyzed. We can see that certain social media platforms are more prevalent during certain time spans in terms of where popular memes originate from.</p>
          <p class="question">What data is encoded in the visualization?</p>
          <p>Information on the percent of the shares of origination of memes in a twelve year time span from nine different social media platforms.</p>
          <p class="question">How does the visualization encode the data?</p>
          <p>It encodes it in a line chart that uses color to distinguish which social media platform corresponds to which line tracing percentage.</p>
          <p class="question">What tasks do readers perform on the visualization?</p>
          <p>Readers are able to compare the percentage of origination per year that each social media company had. They are also able to gain insight into the influence these platforms have had over the past decade and draw conclusions about the popularity of said platforms.</p>
          <p class="question">How are the five principles applied to this visualization?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Beautiful: It is aesthetically pleasing to look at and the colors in specific compliment one another nicely making it beautiful to viewers.</li> 
            <li>Functional: The graph is constructed in a way that it can be easily analyzed by viewers with the lines being easily distinguishable and the data being easy to understand and digest.</li>
            <li>Insightful: It uses data - looking at where memes were shared from - that as readers we would not necessarily have access to, and certainly would not look at a sample this size without this graph being available.</li>
            <li>Truthful: The visualization is truthful because it took a sample of between 700-1,400 memes and analyzed the percentage of meme origin shares it had across nine different platforms. </li>
            <li>Enlightening: It is enlightening because as readers we can understand where memes are being shared from and how this relates to both the popularity of certain platforms over a given period of time and how platforms eb and flow in popularity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="question">Why is this visualization good</p>
          <p>We believe that this visualization is good because it is not only aesthetically pleasing and conveys interesting and relevant information about the origin of popular memes, but because it is truthful and easy to understand for readers. The design itself is very clean and straightforward, which limits the need for over-analysis by readers and the possibility of misunderstanding the data. The use of color in the line chart makes it easy to identify which line corresponds to which company and track the overall progression of meme origins.</p>

          <p class="question">Who is the audience?</p>
          <p>This graph is for people who are interested in politics and racial divides on voting. With the upcoming election, voting matters, so every American has the responsibility to vote. It is important to understand the demographics to heal the divide between two parties.</p>
          <p class="question">What message and questions does this visualization convey and answer?</p>
          <p>This visualization wants to convey the voting situation of non-white votes during the 2018 midterm election. The message is interesting that there are a lot fewer voters for the Republicans by taking the white voters out. The southern and midwest states are blue for the majority parts. Those blue districts, typically red, are usually rural. On the other hand, it indicates that white voters are the key for the Republican party to win many districts that are originally republican. Many rural southern and midwest white voters are conservative.</p>
          <p class="question">What data is encoded in the visualization?</p>
          <p>The encoded data are the projected results for the midterm election in 2018 without white voters. The data have details for whether each district is predicted to be democratic or republican.</p>
          <p class="question">How does the visualization encode the data?</p>
          <p>IThe visualization encodes data through a map and colors. The map tells districts in each state, and colors are traditionally represented as democratic or republican.</p>
          <p class="question">What tasks do readers perform on the visualization?</p>
          <p>Readers can compare the number of districts projected for each party, and they can also see where the districts are predicted to support each party, both without white voters. Voters can mouse over each district and see details.</p>
          <p class="question">How are the five principles applied to this visualization?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Beautiful: It utilizes the colors well, where blue and red are a contrast. The map has white boundaries between districts, which does not overwhelm the colors indicating parties.</li> 
            <li>Functional: This graph demonstrates each district, and people can easily mouse on any of them and see the details. The top tally also tells people which party has a projected majority without white voters.</li>
            <li>Insightful: The data separate out a certain race and tell the voting patterns from then. People can compare this with their perceptions about voting and see how much white voters are influencing each district.</li>
            <li>Truthful: The visualization is truthful because the data are from the registered voters’ information. It also conforms people’s expectations that non-white voters are more liberal compared to white voters. </li>
            <li>Enlightening: People will find this visualization enlightening because it is a timely topic. The midterm election is coming in a few weeks, and it is also a critical election looking at a few important issues in the county. Understanding who will vote for which party helps understand the problems needed to solve.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="question">Why is this visualization good?</p>
          <p>This visualization is good because it investigates an important issue, which is the racial divide in voters. With the midterm election coming up, it helps people rethink the current political environment around this country and the reason behind the divide, such systemic racism and immigration. In addition, the visualization is clear with the map and the grid. The grid explicitly shows which party is dominating, and the map helps people identify where non white voters are voting for whom. Even though it is not creative about the colors, the traditional red and blue are easy for people to understand.</p>

          <p class="question">Who is the audience?</p>
          <p>The audience is people who want to sell or buy their houses in the central Austin area. The sellers and buyers are looking for a broker.</p>
          <p class="question">What message and questions does this visualization convey and answer?</p>
          <p>The message this visualization wants to convey is that the average sales price has gone up from 2020 to 2022, especially a huge rise in 2022. It means the broker is good at selling houses at a higher price, so the homeowner can earn more money if they sell it through Sam. However, because the audience also contains home buyers, if they see the average sales prices going up, it might be a drawback for them to buy their homes in central Austin. Thus, the visualization only approaches one side of the audience.</p>
          <p class="question">What data is encoded in the visualization?</p>
          <p>The data is the average sales price, but we are not clear about how exactly the sales price is calculated. </p>
          <p class="question">How does the visualization encode the data?</p>
          <p>The visualization encodes data through a bar chart. However, the axis of the bar chart has the wrong scale.</p>
          <p class="question">What tasks do readers perform on the visualization?</p>
          <p>Readers will read the bar chart and see the average sales price in each year, and they will see the sales prices are increasing. They will interpret that the average sales price is specifically higher in 2022.</p>
          <p class="question">How are the five principles applied to this visualization?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Beautiful: The visualization is appealing because the bars have some white spaces in between, and the years are clear. The color getting darker encodes the proceeding of the years.</li> 
            <li>Functional: The visualization is not fully functional. Even though sellers might see the average sales prices are ideal to sell their houses, it is not what buyers are looking for.</li>
            <li>Insightful: This visualization is not insightful, because it is simply an advertisement, which also failed to achieve its full purposes.</li>
            <li>Truthful: The visualization is not truthful because there is no reliable data source of how much the average sales price for this broker is. Also, the axis is not correct, so the 2022 average sales price looks a lot higher, even though the difference is not big considering the price of housing.</li>
            <li>Enlightening: The visualization is not enlightening because people do not see that they can perform any further tasks with the data. Also, people will find the scale confusing because it is not matching the statistics, and people might find the advertisement lying.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="question">Why is this visualization bad?</p>
          <p>This visualization is bad because it is not telling the truth first. The scale of the axis is not corresponding to the average sales price. Also, the advertisement makes the average sales price for 2022 intentionally higher, but it might be the rise of the housing market and the heat of moving to Austin. Also, the visualization fails to appeal to the audience because only sellers look for higher average sales prices, and the buyer will find a cheaper home with a certain house condition. The bar chart only shows the side benefitting the sellers, but the broker works with both buyers and sellers. Thus, he might lose some buyers from his hand.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="TextWrap">
        <p class="question">Who is the audience?</p>
        <p>The audience is people interested in the Twitter landscape including learning how different people on Twitter are part of different clusters and how their interrelationships are structured.</p>
        <p class="question">What message and questions does this visualization convey and answer?</p>
        <p>This visualization tries to convey the network type of the polarized crowd network. The depiction features two different groups of Twitter users divided into fairly distinct clusters over a political debate in 2012 proposed by the White House called #My2K. The visualization is a sample of 688 different twitter users who tweeted with this hashtag and their relationship to one another through a network graph. The intention is to show that with a polarizing topic or hashtag on Twitter, two very distinct clusters of networks form and the users on either side have little bridge or connection to the other group.</p>
        <p class="question">What data is encoded in the visualization?</p>
        <p>The data of 688 Twitter accounts from January 6, 2013 to January 8, 2013 and their communication and connection/relationship with one another as it relates to the hashtag #My2K.</p>
        <p class="question">How does the visualization encode the data?</p>
        <p>The data is encoded with what is supposed to be a Network map. It is supposed to represent who each account reacts to and put a line according to that connection. Additionally, they include the ten biggest tweets that are the most popular from the two polarized groups. All the users who don’t reply to anyone or have any outside connection but are still referencing the #My2K has hashtags around them.</p>
        <p class="question">What tasks do readers perform on the visualization?</p>
        <p>Readers are hypothetically supposed to see the two separate disjoint groups and understand that they maintain a good barrier of isolation from each other. There are very few bridges between the two clusters, and the other popular hashtags amongst the groups also differ greatly.</p>
        <p class="question">How are the five principles applied to this visualization?</p>
        <p>Beautiful: Not that aesthetically pleasing to look at because it looks like a dysfunctional mess of lines without an end. Limited thought put into things like colors that might make the visual more appealing to viewers. Functional: This visual is supposed to serve as a means to show that polarizing topics can create groups that can’t see past what their network is thinking but it’s not particularly successful in this function. Insightful: This graph does use data that is relatively inaccessible to the public and tracks the connection between different twitter accounts and what is popular amongst network groups. Truthful: The visualization is truthful because it uses data from Twitter across a specified two day timeline in order to illuminate the connection between accounts, their interests, and their connections. Enlightening: It is enlightening because as readers we can use the concept of the graph and understand how polarizing topics create a divide that if not overcome will dictate that people only really know the ideology of their fellow network rather than being exposed to more widespread information.        </p>
        <p class="question">Why is this visualization bad?</p>
        <p>This visualization is bad because it is extremely confusing, lacks good formatting, and overall is not very aesthetically pleasing or easily accessible for viewers. The concept of the visualization is strong - tracking how polarizing ideas or tweets can actually create subgroups that don’t end up communicating with people outside of their network - but the execution of the visualization is really poor. This visualization is very difficult to read because the network just looks like a tight ball of lines, and the lines often overlap the different hashtags and the users. Additionally, there should be more of an emphasis I think on the crossover portion of the graph because the main goal of the visualization seems to be to emphasize the lack of communication between two polarized groups. By structuring this graph in a different way, it would be much easier for readers to understand what they are looking at as well as emphasize the parts of the graph that actually bring meaning to the visual rather than just a mess of lines.</p>
